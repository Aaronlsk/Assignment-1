# Assignment-1
This website is based on a Fictional Japnese Idol Group B-Komachi. The first two pages of the website displays the history behind the group and an introduction of the members for anyone who is interested to learn more about the group. The next page contains a schedule for any fans looking to join any future events or concerts. The store page is here for fans to purchase merchandise if they want to further support the group. The music page allows people to watch videos containing past performances promotes their first album. Lastly, there's a subscription page for fans who would like to have regular news regarding the group to always keep up to date with anything in the future. The design I have consists of bright purple and pink colours which meshes well with the group's colour scheme and is appealing to people who visit the website
