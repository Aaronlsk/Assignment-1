# Your Project's Name

This website is based on a Fictional Japnese Idol Group B-Komachi. The first two pages of the website displays the history behind the group and an introduction of the members for anyone who is interested to learn more about the group. The next page contains a schedule 
for any fans looking to join any future events or concerts. The store page is here for fans to purchase merchandise if they want to further support the group. The music page allows people to watch videos containing past performances promotes their first album. Lastly, 
there's a subscription page for fans who would like to have regular news regarding the group to always keep up to date with anything in the future. The design I have consists of bright purple and pink colours which meshes well with the group's colour scheme and is 
appealing to people who visit the website.
 
## Design Process
For the design process, I felt like using bright and vibrant colors was the best way of appealing to visitors of the website and they represent the group's identity fairly well in my opinion. For who the websiite is for, it is mainly for fans of the group or people who recently heard about them or went to their concert for the first time and wants to check out the group and learn more about the group, be it history, members or wanting to purchase some merchandise that can support the group as well. If I wanted to find out more about a group, I would go to their website which should contain information about them and if I'm a fan, I would like to know when their future concerts are so that I can book tickets in advance which the tour section helps display and may also want a reliable way of getting daily news about the group which is where the subscription page can allow me to.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Subscription form:
    1. Go to the "SUBSCRIBE" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
